SmallMachine
============

SmallMachine is the culmination of years of tinkering with state machine engines with the goal of making them both simpler and more powerful; some older, more complicated, versions are still in my [statemachine](https://github.com/inventhouse/statemachine/) repo 'cos I don't like throwing things away :sweat-smile:
